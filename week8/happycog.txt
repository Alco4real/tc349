Happy Cog uses a very simple yet effective way of presenting their sites content. One of the things I often complain about is inconsistency in a websites design, and Happy Cog doesn’t have to worry about that because all of their content is on one consistent page. All the content is framed to fit in the middle of the screen and looks great full screen or windowed. The headers and subtitles are clear to read and break up the different sections nicely. Furthermore, the clean black/white content is contrasted nicely by the colors of images throughout the page.

One key thing that caught my attention was the navigation bar. Its placement from the onset of loading the page is below the title/header. As soon as you begin to scroll however, it is fixed at the top of the screen. It handles very smooth and flows well with the type of content layout they use especially considering that their links are in chronological order with how they appear along the page. The red-orange they use as a highlight makes them stand out and it’s nice to see bright headers and footers.
