For my development environment, I chose to run with Dreamweaver CS5 and Firefox. I have worked with Dreamweaver in the past, and I love the code/split/design views and how easy it is to switch between them. I am also a fan of the one click publish button (I am sure other dev tools have this, but it is convinient).
I use Mozilla Firefox as my primary web browser, love the tabs, have most of the hotkeys memorized so it just made sense to use it instead of switching to chrome. Although some of the newer features of Mozilla 15.0.1 moved some things around, it still is pretty efficient as a browser.
Furthermore, as far as code goes, I usually type it straight into Dreamweaver, and I usually use Microsoft Word to type content before posting it onto the web.
