So after sweeping through the pages of Mr. Jason Maria's site, I noticed that he is adamant about sticking to his simple color scheme. Red, black, and white are the only colors you see on the site (save for images). This is great in most cases to keep a site on a simple color palette, but because the site seems to focus around articles and chunks of text, I think he could benefit from having more eye catching headers instead of just red font.

One of things I like about his site is the consistency and how organized it is, especially the footer section. Sometimes you run into a site that has 100 links, but Jason does a good job of keeping it simple and easy to find what you are looking for. Also, the search bar is a great feature to have, especially with an article based site.

Although the site is clean, I do go back to my previous point of it being too white and simple. Some bars or other seperators would go a long way in giving eyes a break from walls of text.
