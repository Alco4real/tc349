The site I will be reviewing is the Dungeons & Dragons main page (http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Default.aspx). I do not have a mobile phone that can access the internet, so I will be reviewing this site between my desktop computer (22 inch monitor) and my 10 inch net book. As far as my mobile experience goes, in general, it just takes longer to get where I need to go. I had to increase the page size (Ctrl +) in order to read some of the text, which I feel should have been accounted for on smaller screen sizes. At this screen size and resolution, I feel like I am navigating an entire newspaper four square inches at time.
The main logo and the login button are both blurry even though it doesn’t ruin the experience much. The other links and text are crystal clear. Even though my net book experience isn’t much different from my desktop experience, I do feel like they could have used a meta tag to have their site respond to small screen sizes by having their site move to a one column layout or just have their divs positioned differently so they don’t fall off the original screen space.
