At first glance, one can tell right away that Vimeo is a very colorful and  
lively site. The splash image and other page art are very whimsical. For  
being a video playing/uploading site I would picture the search bar being  
larger, but Vimeo does feature a drop-down menu for that in its navigation so I guess the need is fulfilled. Furthermore, the "What can you do here?"  
section is a bit farther down the page than what would be useful on the main  
page, perhaps leave the main page relegated to recent news and have a  
separate page for "what you can do here".

Most of the side pages (through the explore tab) use a white template but  
have varied layouts from two-column to fluid/multi-column. Even though these  
side pages are consistent in theme, I feel like vimeos main page has many  
different color schemes to it. I would either keep the main page consistent,  
or add some color to the other pages.
