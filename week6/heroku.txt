Heroku is a very clean looking site. The color scheme is very nice to look at with dark purple and charcoal as main colors and light green, light blue and orange as accents (More on color later). There also is a consistent theme with the icons and images representing "iconic Japanese" culture items (origami, cranes, puffer fish, Gundams, etc) which is a very memorable feature.
The home page uses a very space-conserving approach to showing multiple tabs of information with a slide-show style view port. The pricing page uses a similar approach except in the form of an interactive calculator. The add-ons page (which is consistent with the Green theme of add-ons in other pages of the site) is a cool blue-green hue, and uses a dual column, multi-blocked layout. Similar to other shopping sites, this layout is easy to use as a browsing based shopping experience.
Unfortunately, there is a negative side to Heroku and that is the Dev Center page. All of these beautifully themed pages and widgets and WHAM, you get hit with a wall of white and text. I do not know why they made the background color so much different on this page than the others, but it was quite inconsistent.

On a different note, I had a good time setting up my layout for my personal site. I chose to do a single column site mainly because each page has its own focus, so there should only be one column/focus per page. I also made a fixed navigation and footer so that users can navigate to any page or return to the top of any page at any time (once I get the return to top link in place). I also took some insights from this week's videos by setting up “section” and “article” tags for easy weekly posting type content.
