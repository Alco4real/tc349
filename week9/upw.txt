United Pixelworkers has a layout that works with almost any window size but that is because everything is formatted in rectangles. Although it keeps things consistent there doesnt seem to be any order to a lot of their content. Their featured products are first but below that is a jumble of rectangles relating to everything else: jobs, blogs, twitter, and an assortment of tees. I personally feel that the site would look and feel better if the non-merchandise content was relegated to living at the side of the page in its own collumn.

I was unsure of how I felt about the small, unobrusive links in the navigation bar until I zoomed in and saw that the nav bar acually goes into a drop-down format when the resolution gets to a certain size (cool!). I actually prefer the site in a more zoomed in resolution, just because of the simplified veiw. Also. simple colors (reds whites and blues) and fonts work well by not distracting users, just quickly giving them the info they need. Overall, this site gives a very laid back feeling, but it is not afraid to have more professional tabs (like the Jobs and About page) be clearly organized.
