Etsy has a pretty bland site. Just white background, light blue links and simple thumbnail images. All the images are horizontally centered which keeps it the main focus of the site. Also, the search bar is smack-dab at the top of the page, right next to the Sign In and Register buttons, which is a convenient place to put it.
However, there is no real information/introduction to the site. Also, the light green font for the item prices is hard to read, as well as the light grey they use for the seller of said items. I know its bland to use black and white all the time but the contrast really does make a difference. All and all, Etsy provides a practical, unobtrusive, barely colorless design that lets the shopper focus on shopping.
