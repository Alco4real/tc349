First thing that comes to mind when viewing the MSU home page is the color scheme. Green and white are the predominant colors, with offshoots of dark green or grey to round things out. This is great from a thematic point of view, but sometimes text gets lost when there is light text on light grey, or light grey text on a white background. It makes some things feel less important.
Navigation is simple because of the drop-down menus and their easy to read titles. Although the sub links (Students, Faculty & Staff, etc.) could be a bit larger in my opinion simply because they should tailor the site to be easy to use for students and staff. There is a lot of javascript keeping the page looking fresh and alive (and giving your mouse plenty of things to click on and cycle through).
In summary, the linked pages are all very uniform in layout and are simple to read, while the homepage is more of a visual news center. There are a lot of links to take in, but if you use the drop-down menus, it makes navigating a bit more organized.
