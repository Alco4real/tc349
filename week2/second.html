<h1>About Me</h1>

<br>


<p>	Scott Compau is a senior at Michigan State University currently studying Video Game Design. Being from the small town of Oxford, MI, Scott had to be charismatic to survive. (And survive he did!) Today, Scott boasts 3D modeling skills as well as a few years of game design under his belt. His games have won multiple awards including Most Playable (Songbird) and Best Aesthetics (Mistbane). Other than playing games for research and as a hobby, Scott also plays the bass guitar and can sing too! Scott has the ability to improvise many facets of his lifestyle and lives by the mantra: "If you can't make a fool of yourself, you are fooling yourself." </p>

<h1> Site Review </h1>
<p> The following text is a review of <a href="http://panic.com/"> Panic.com</a>. First off, I am not a Apple product user by choice, but do use them at Michigan State on occasion. That being said, lets get to some critiques. </p>
<p> In true Apple-fashion, Panic.com boldly displays the simplistic icons of the applications they provide. No matter where you turn, those app icons are there. The home page is colorful and simple, and they don't dangle that extra "footer info" in front of you when you first load up the page (you have to scroll down past their well designed top space). As far as navigation goes, the use of simple icons on each page is a good thematic device. Also, each page branching from Panic has a large mono-colored header with one icon on it, very simple and effective.
<p> As for the rest of the content, there are plenty of relevant pictures and condensed information that makes reading through each page much more enjoyable than facing a wall of text. Overall, even though I think Panic goes a little more on the simple side of things, I think the site does its job (marketing) well. <b>5/5</b> </p>
