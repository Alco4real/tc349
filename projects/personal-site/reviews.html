<h1>Game Reviews</h1>

<p>This page is relegated to the review of video games. I play many different types of games, mainly on the PC but not excluding Xbox or Wii titles. I use the gaming platforms of Steam and Origin to buy or demo new games and love to give my opinion of them. I am currently playing Smite, Guild Wars 2, and Battlefield 3, so expect reviews of all of them soon!<p>
