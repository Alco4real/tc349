<h1>Game Reviews</h1>

<p class="tab">This page is relegated to the review of video games. I play many different types of games, mainly on the PC but not excluding Xbox or Wii titles. I use the gaming platforms of Steam and Origin to buy or demo new games and love to give my opinion of them. I am currently playing Smite, Guild Wars 2, and Battlefield 3, so expect reviews of all of them soon!<p>

<h1> Guild Wars 2</h1>
<p class="tab">I have spent a good number of hours these last few weeks playing Guild Wars 2 and I can honestly say that I've got my money's worth out of it.  I won't spend too much time describing the game as that information is readily available at Guildwars.com and the Guild Wars 2 Wiki. In summary, GW2 is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game with all the major amenities you would expect from an MMO with exceptional marks with character progression, story development, and group dynamics. 
<p class="tab">Character progression is handled superbly on many different levels and the game never has felt like a chore to play. This is mainly because the game rewards you for playing <strong>whichever way you want</strong>. Exploring new lands, gathering crafting materials, crafting items, killing enemies, doing area quests and even reviving fallen allies grant experience points. No matter what you choose to do in the game you get rewarded for it. 
<p class="tab">Another large part of character progression is "talent tree" and skill growth, both of which are handled almost perfectly. For instance, the skills you learn representative of the weapon type you are wielding (an Elementalist wielding a dagger will have more close range, rapid fire spells compared to one who is wielding a staff). This means that weapon selection is an important factor in which role your character plays. Don't worry, many of the weapons can be used in combination with another so there are plenty of options to choose from. <p class="tab">Lastly, Hero Traits allow you to allocate points into five categories that increase specific stats and unlock special abilities at set milestones. These abilities range from passive cooldown reductions to abilities that activate when you are at low health. All in all, the "trait tree" combined with weapon and armor selection lead to a large variation in character builds that are intuitively labeled and easy to understand.
<p class="tab">
The story in Guild Wars 2 revolves around you. The choices you make influence where you go and what you will do which is much needed freedom from the "one-story for everyone" approach (I am looking at you World of Warcraft). In short, the missions and cinematic sequences blend wonderfully with each other. Even the dungeons have a place in the story in contrast to being a place on a map that needed to be filled with a hot-spot. However, if you only play the main story missions you will quickly be at a disadvantage for the quests increase in difficulty pretty quick. 
<p class="tab">
As a final point of discussion in this review, I have come to talk about group dynamics. I couldn't have asked for a better system. The all-powerful triad of Tank, Healer, DPS has been finally broken. Sure, you can stereotype your character into one of those groupings but <strong>the beautiful thing is that you do not have to</strong>. Even though there are heavy, medium, and light armor classes, each player can do damage and have utility in the form of damage reduction or taking damage. This means a lot of things, but mainly that you will no longer be denied by groups simply because of your overall class selection. Speaking of groups, you can make them of course (up to 5 people), but if you are fighting a monster and someone else comes and helps kill it, you both gain the experience. The same applies for crafting materials. No longer will people fight over resources, because everyone has access to them. 
<p>
Guild Wars 2 has tried something bold and <strong>succeeded immensely</strong>. Their players have meaningful choices in a world that promotes working with one another. This review has avoided the negative aspects such as a lack of endgame content, no large scale Player VS Environment Raids (that I know of), but that is all out-shined because the bulk of the game is incredibly fun to play. In conclusion, I give Guild Wars 2 a <strong>9.5 out of 10</strong> as a shining beacon of hope in a genre dominated by a lot of the same crap. </p>
