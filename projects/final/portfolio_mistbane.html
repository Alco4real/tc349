  <h1>On an island shrouded by mist...</h1>
  <p class="tab"> Mistbane was a large scale game for a five week project. The theme was mystery, and we chose to make the player someone who has been washed ashore on a small island with all their memories erased. We had a great artist on the team so we decided to have a 3rd person game with lots of animations and great looking NPC's. We also split the game's four islands between the designers as each of us wanted to have a piece of the game to call our own.
 
  <p class="tab">My main focus on this project was level design and audio. I created the Ruins and Ruins Temple in their entirety as well as most of Monster Isle. I used garage band to compose all six music tracks and used Audacity for all of the sound effects that weren't free sound samples.
  <p class="tab">I loved working on this title and I am proud of it. I only wish we had more time to polish the finer details of combat and have more refined level designs.
