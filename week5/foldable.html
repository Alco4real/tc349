<h1>Foldable.me Card Sort</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="info">The process I went through for this card sorting experiment for Foldable.me was pretty simple. I looked through the site page by page, marking down on WebSort.net the titles and content that stuck out to me. I put the layout how I would have set it up and then asked my three roomates to do the same.<p>
  <p><span class="info">The largest difference between our choices were how we titled each page. Many of us used our own rendition of a similar themed title (although we likely picked similar titles because we were in the same room while doing the sorting experiment).<br />
 <p><span class="info">If I were to do this again, I would pick more people to test and do a closed sort with one individual at a time to see where the content would fall in the predetermined groups. This would avoid the different content titles and provide more effective feedback.<br />
