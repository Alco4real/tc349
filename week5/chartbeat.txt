Chartbeat uses a lot of visual guides to tell a story. Who they are and what they do is all on one page, which is moved along via "next" buttons. The information at each checkpoint is concise enough to read without getting overwhelmed, for if it weren't broken into chunks, would be a giant wall of text.
They are clearly backing up what they can do with all of their imbedded infomercial like adds. It is very interesting to watch numbers and images change on the fly depending on what you are doing on the site.
Blue and white color scheme works well and is clean to look at. Furthermore, the subpages use the same scheme although less images/background color's to spruce it up. All in all, very colorful and fun site for a very serious company.
